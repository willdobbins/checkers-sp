===========

This was an old project I started on back when canvas was news to me.  It sat
dormant for a while once I had messed around with raw canvas drawing enough to
satisfy my curiousity, but I think I might finish it up in the near future, at
least to the point of having head to head games possible.

Bit of a low bar, in terms of difficulty, but it's far enough along that it
should be finished.
